# Supplier Product List
Assesment project for The Big Phone Store

#### How to run this project

Please run the following command

`php parser.php --file=products_comma_separated.csv --unique-combinations=combination_count.csv`

You can replace these file names as per needs but make sure products_comma_separated.csv file should be in the same directory where the parser.php file is


#### Notes

I have tried to consider and include all the below points mentioned in the task

  - Implement Design Patterns, adhere to OOP principles, incorporate DI (Dependency Injection), and follow SOLID principles where possible in your test submission.
  - New formats could be introduced in the future ie. (json, xml etc).
  - File headings could change in the future.
  - Some files can be very large so watch out for memory usage.
  - The code should be excutable from a terminal.
  - Please provide brief read me describing how to run your application.
  - PHP 7+ must be used.
  - Should be built using native PHP and no third party libraries.
  - Required fields if not found within file should throw an exception.
  - You can use Composer to autoload files.
